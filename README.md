## Hello / Howzit / Goeie dag 👋

<!--
My name is Liezl Mari Vermeulen and I am a PhD student and geospatial data enthusiast. I am completing a PhD in Bioscience Engineering at KU Leuven (Belgium), in collaboration with the African Climate and Development Insitute in Cape Town (South Africa).

My background is in geoinformatics and environmental sciences, and nowadays I spend most of my time observing plants from space using satellites and fancy models 🛰️🌏My focus areas are currently savannas and fynbos (a special kind of Mediteranean ecosystem only found in South Africa). 

I am most comfortable coding in Python and R, but have also dabbled in Javascript (for Google Eartn Engine), Java, C and HTML.
